Proxmox Kubernetes with Terraform
----
# WIP
This is a work in progress. I'm just getting the shell in place as I work through the setup / testing steps.

It is only using a single server for all of the instances, I'm not rich ;)

*NOTE*: Please note there are some hard-coded IP addresses and ranges in a few of the scripts. You will want to grep for "192.168.1" and review them as needed.

# Requirements
* Proxmox Terraform Provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox
* export of `PM_PASS` variable
* Fill out a "terraform.tfvars" file to pass to Terraform.
* Use daily image from here: https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/buster/
* Prepare cloud-init previous image: https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Cloud-Init_Support

# Issues
* A `lifecycle` block is needed to ignore changes to the "network" section as subsequent applies mess with networking. This is a known issue with the Terraform Proxmox provider: https://github.com/Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox/issues/112.
